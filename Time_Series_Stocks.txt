Instructions for running: Time_Series_Stocks.py:

1) The program was written for and compiled with Python 2.7.9;
      please use this when testing or running the application.

2) The program will ask for a user input for the number of days they wish to
      increment the time series. Note, the input tests and expects a positive
      value for the program to run. Any fractional value will be rounded down
      to an integer

3) Note, I used the properties of the math function "sin" rather than the
      function itself to decrease the computational complexity of the program.
      The properties used are listed in the comments above the main function.

4) The program will run and produce daily output and financial results of the
      time-series.
